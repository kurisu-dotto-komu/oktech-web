# Project Workflow Rules

## Development Environment
- A dev server is running in the background - do not start it yourself
- Use existing dev server for testing and verification

## Git Operations
- Never make git commits unless explicitly instructed
- No automatic commits, pushes, or other git operations
- Wait for explicit user permission before any git action

## Testing
- For Playwright tests, always use headless mode (default)
- Never use --headed mode unless specifically requested
- Use `npm run typecheck` after editing imports to ensure they're working (quick and easy)
- Run tests with: `npm run test` for dev testing (somewhat expensive)
- Use `npm run test:build` very sparingly at the end of big changes (very expensive)
