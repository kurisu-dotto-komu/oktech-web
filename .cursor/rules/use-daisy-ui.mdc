# Use Daisy UI Components

When creating elements or components, always try to use Daisy UI v5 components and utilities as much as reasonably possible.

## Component Usage Guidelines

❌ Wrong:
```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click me
</button>
```

✅ Correct:
```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Click me</button>
```

## Theme Configuration
- Use Daisy UI theme colors (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)
- Maintain consistent theme across components

## Best Practices
1. Check the [Daisy UI Components](mdc:https:/daisyui.com/components) documentation first
2. Use semantic class names (e.g., `btn-primary` over custom color classes)
3. Combine with Tailwind utilities when needed for fine-tuning
4. Keep accessibility in mind - Daisy UI components are built with a11y in mind

Example implementation in the navigation component.
