# Internal Links and Routing

For all internal links within the application, use the specialized Link components that handle path prefixing:

## Astro Components
```astro
---
import Link from "@/components/Common/Link.astro";
---

<Link href="/about">About Us</Link>
```

## React Components
```tsx
import LinkReact from "@/components/Common/LinkReact";

<LinkReact href="/products">Products</LinkReact>
```

Key points:
- These components automatically handle path prefixing
- Never use raw `<a>` tags for internal navigation
- External links can use standard `<a>` tags with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
