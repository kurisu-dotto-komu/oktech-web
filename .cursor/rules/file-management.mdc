# File Management Rules

## File Creation and Editing
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Only create new files when absolutely necessary for the task
- Never proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files
- Only create documentation when explicitly requested by the user

## Code Organization
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Place new components in appropriate existing directories
- Maintain consistency with existing file naming conventions
- Check neighboring files for style and structure patterns
