Gregory King is a long-time community member passionate about pushing the limits of browser performance. In his talk "Building Front-end Apps with WebAssembly and Rust" he shared hands-on lessons from rewriting JavaScript components in Rust and compiling them to WASM, illustrating where the new approach shines, the tooling involved, and pitfalls to avoid when targeting the DOM from low-level languages.
