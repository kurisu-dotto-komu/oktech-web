Founder and chief organiser of OWDDM/KWDDM, Martin Heidegger regularly jumps on stage to share deep dives into modern web problemsâ€”from GraphQL fundamentals through the nuances of login UX, React patterns in 2024, to hands-on AWS S3 and WebAuthn workshops. His talks pair architectural insight with practical code examples and always finish with a call to experiment and share knowledge.
