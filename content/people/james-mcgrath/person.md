James McGrath is a Kansai-based front-end freelancer who delights in making the web both beautiful **and** accessible. His talks range from hard-won lessons building performant WordPress sites through deep dives into modern CSS concepts, to live-coding sessions where he fearlessly updates the OWDDM website in real time. James is passionate about sharing practical techniques that help developers ship elegant user-interfaces without sacrificing performance or accessibility. When he is not speaking you can usually find him on CodePen experimenting with the next wave of CSS features.
