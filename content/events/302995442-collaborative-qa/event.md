Hello friends,

it is finally not super-hot anymore ðŸ˜œ. leaves are turning read and we are doing something a little different this month.

For the meetup in October we are having a _"Bring your own questions"_ collaborative Q&A session. You bring your question and we are going to try to answer them together. ðŸ¤—

To keep it a little bit in scope, let's try to keep it roughly in the _"Web design & development"_ category. Below are some example questions but please bring your own! If you can, also share them on [â†’ Discord](https://owddm.com/discord), specifically in [â†’ this thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1280878880168611891) so we can maybe think about the questions a bit in advance as well.

- _"What to do when I accidentally ran \`rm -rf /\`?"_
- _"How do you start designing a website?"_
- _"When is my code good enough?"_
- _"Why is centering a div hard?"_
- _"How much should I charge for an icon?"_

If there are questions that you always wanted to know about, that maybe could be answered by people with more experience, please join us for a nice Saturday evening.
