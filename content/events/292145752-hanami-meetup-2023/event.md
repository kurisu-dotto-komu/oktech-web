Happy Spring everyone! 👋

We took a step back beginning of the year, but we are still here!

Our sister event [OWDDM](https://www.meetup.com/osaka-web-designers-and-developers-meetup/) is still going strong and we think of coming back to Kyoto this year! 🚀

And how to start the year better than meet for a Hanami? We were planning to visit Kamo River together and bring nice snacks/drinks that we share and have easy conversations.
The weather forecast shows that it might be rainy and it would be better to meet at [Cafe Planet](https://goo.gl/maps/U4dwddrppUBBL9MA8).

We plan to start around 2pm (14:00) and will be there until evening. Of course you are free to join/leave as it suits you ☺️

Join us for an easy Saturday afternoon celebrating the nice-weather season!

_Note:_ We are a group of grown-ups but some of us have kids and we want to welcome them and their families at the meetup too!
