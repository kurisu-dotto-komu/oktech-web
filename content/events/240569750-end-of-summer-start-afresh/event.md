Hello Developers and Designers!

The Summer is coming to an end, and while many of us still haven't returned from their summer hideouts in the home country, the rest of us are looking forward to meet again! This month sooner than usual, we shall meet on September 16th, hosted once more by awesome Aiming (http://aiming-inc.com).

This month we are focusing a bit on the organizational side of web projects.

The fabulous Timothy Andersen will be sharing his experience with "Trials and Tribulations of Building a 2-sided Marketplace" that he gathered when building up Musby (http://musby.com).

Additionally the very talented JB Curtin (http://jbcurtin.io) will talk about failing. Specifically code that fails and how to notice it in his talk "Failures Happen. Tools for distributed systems".

As usual you will have the chance to connect and we will head out for drinks afterwards.
