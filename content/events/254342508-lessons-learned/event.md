Wow, this summer was hot! We plan to keep it chilled at this months OWDDM by breaking a bit out of our usual format.

This month we will - for the first time - be able to use the new Sakura Internet space in the south tower of the Grandfront Building!

In this spacious cafe / meeting space we would like to invite you to join us for listening to lessons that some of our experienced folks have learned in their work life. Be it design, workflow, programming or human related, we are looking forward to a few 5~10 minute mini-presentations with conversations in between.

We hope you can join us for a nice evening, where some of us will head out for drinks afterwards.

yours
Martin.

On another note: Many of this years presentations came to happen because of your feedback. If you would like to hear or speak about something in a future or this meetup, please let us know! ðŸ‘‡.
