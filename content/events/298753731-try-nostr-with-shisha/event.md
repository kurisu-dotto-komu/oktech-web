Calling for all are curious about Web3 and distributed protocols!

In this small hangout is about [NOSTR](https://nostr.com/), which we had a talk before at the OWDDM. Why don't you deepen your understanding by touching actual applications?

Kohei will support you according to your level of understanding. - Learn the history and overview of Nostr - Introduction of existing applications/frameworks - Create a Nostr account/application.

**Note:** Since we are holding this event at a Shisha Bar, you need to be 20 or older to attend - bring an ID!
