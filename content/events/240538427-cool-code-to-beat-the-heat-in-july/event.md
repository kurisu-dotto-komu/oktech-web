Join us at air-conditioned Aiming Inc. to have a refreshing time of learning from each other.

We all go through journeys of discovery, and sometimes that leads to unconventional decisions about what technologies to use. Our two talks this time will have that theme in common.

First, UX/bot designer Aska Uda (https://www.meetup.com/Osaka-Web-Designers-and-Developers-Meetup/members/96374152/) will share with us about her work on the design of her company's travel AI bot, including why they decided to make it a bot instead of an app.

Then this meetup's host Karen Ellrick (https://www.meetup.com/Osaka-Web-Designers-and-Developers-Meetup/members/84880272/) will share a talk she will call either "Paper is Not Dead" or "Using an Ancient Tool to Solve a Modern Problem" - two use cases that needed precise layouts of database data, and how the saga of trying to accomplish that in a web app led to using LaTeX to build PDFs on the fly.

As always, after the meetup those who are interested can go with us to a nearby izakaya for drinks, food, and getting to know each other - a great time to make new friends of fellow designers/developers/learners!
