Hello Friends, and a Happy New Year to all!

Our January 2024 meetup will be hosted at C2 Kyoto and feature new speaker KÃ©vin Combriat. He will give an introduction to Rust for online services with a particular focus on Axum. ðŸ¦€

As always, if you'd like to get in touch or have any other topics that you would like to talk about, come and say hi in the [â†’ Discord](https://owddm.com/discord)

We look forward to welcoming you soon! ðŸ‘‹
