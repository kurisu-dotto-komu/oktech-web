Hello Friends ðŸ‘‹

With the end of year coming our way quickly, we are getting back into the development saddle in this months meetup.

For the first presentation we will look into SQL Databases. From _"Why are databases a thing?"_ to how to start using them and why. Even in 2024 SQL still has its place in the development stack and we are happy to come back to it. (â†’[Link](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1226757582723612824))

The second presentation is going to be a meta presentation/workshop on the topic of _"How to present"._ OWDDM was conceptualized to be a place where people can try to present things. In this second workshop we are going to try together to become better at presenting our work and passion. (â†’[Link](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1300107151473377382))

We are looking forward for you to join us at the date and until then, see you in â†’ [Discord](https://owddm.com/discord)
