The year is starting through in May and we meet for two community presentations.

For this month, Leif−a very experienced hardware engineer−will share his hobby project of controlling LEDs in a way that anyone should be able to follow.

In our second presentation, security specialist Tillmann will be talking about how to disclose security vulnerability that you find in a system and what his experience has been in the past. (→ [Thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1346346180921135205))
