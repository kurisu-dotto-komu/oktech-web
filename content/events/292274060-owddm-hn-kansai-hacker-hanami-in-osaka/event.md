Happy Spring!👋

This is not a mistake! We have **two Hanamis** this year!
To make it easier for people from other parts of Kansai to join and also because the weather is sometimes tricky, we decided to have a second Hanami one week after [our other Hanami event in Kyoto](https://www.meetup.com/kyoto-web-designers-and-developers-meetup/events/292145752/). 🌸

Our friends at [HNKansai](https://www.meetup.com/hacker-news-kansai/events/292273445/) decided to join us and we would like to invite you to hang out together. 🤗 Bring nice snacks and drinks that we share and let's have easy conversations.

We plan to start around noon and will be there until evening. Of course you are free to join/leave as it suits you ☺️

*Note:* We are a group of grown-ups but some of us have kids and we want to welcome them and their families at the meetup too!

If you have any questions are want to connect on other ways, please [join us in the discord](https://owddm.com/discord).
