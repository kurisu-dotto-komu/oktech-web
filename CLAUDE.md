- we are running a dev server in the background so you don't need to run it yourself
- we are using daisy ui v5 , so always use these components when possible, and use it's theme classes
- always use astro lucide icons when possible; import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components"
- never make git commands like commits unless i explicitly instruct you to
- for internal links, use the Link and LinkReact components as they do prefixing
- never use --headed mode for playwright tests, always use the default headless option
