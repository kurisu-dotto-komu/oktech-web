- we are running a dev server in the background so you don't need to run it yourself
- we are using daisy ui v5 , so always use these components when possible, and use it's theme classes
- always use astro lucide icons when possible; import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components"
- never make git commands like commits unless i explicitly instruct you to
- for internal links, use the Link and LinkReact components as they do prefixing
- never use --headed mode for playwright tests, always use the default headless option
- you can use use `npm run typecheck` to confirm there aren't any import issues if you have recently edited components, feel free to do this frequently as it's cheap
- you can use `npm run test` to make sure everything's working during development, but only do this sparingly as it's quite expensive
- you can use `npm run test:build` to double check things are working after making a big change, use very rarely
- the build step might take a long time, so don't timeout early
