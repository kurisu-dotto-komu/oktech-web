Hello friends,

we are hosted by [Helpfeel](https://www.helpfeel.com/) this September again, for us to meet and step up our game together. ðŸš€

Ben is going to hold a little workshop for us. Let's learn how the [Cursor AI-native IDE](https://www.cursor.com/) can be used to save time writing code. The IDE can help us be faster writing simple web apps with LLMs. The talk will also cover using LLM APIs for building a simple web app with web scraping, custom prompts, and formatted responses.

If you have another topic you would like to talk about, please submit a #presentation-proposal in the [Discord](https://owddm.com/discord).

To join the event, a basic knowledge of web programming will be useful. Also, it would be good to bring your notebook if you want to try it out by yourself.
