Welcome back, dear Web enthusiasts!

We got some feedback that the awesome presentations last month by Karen, Benjamin and Frank have raised an interesting question: What do the senior developers of our group think would be good to start to study? What would they study now? And how can you get into the web profession? etc.

This month we would like to invite you to join us in the discussion on the basics. Designers, Developers, aspiring Members - you are very welcome!

The topics of our group are extremely wide: Design, Usability, Accessibility, SEO, API's, E-Commerce, Hosting, Ruby on Rails, CMS, IoT etc.

To be able to talk about what is interesting to you as a beginner, it would be awesome if you could add a comment and tell us what mystery of the web you would like to uncover! We will then select a few topics and see if someone can talk about what those topics basics are and how to learn best more about it.

After the meetup we will go out to an Izakaya for drinks and conversation!

We hope to see you on Apr. 23rd at Conference room of Aiming, the gaming company that kindly let us use their space!

Note: This is the first meetup that will be co-organized by Victor Trofin. He is a beginner and he will be bringing extra-good questions!
