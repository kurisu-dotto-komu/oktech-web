It is July and Osaka is hot! Both literally and figuratively. So many events and opportunities pop up that it almost feels startup-y here. Come to join us to talk about web development and design!

As usually we have open discussions with people of many fields: graphic design, DBA (Database Admins), HTML, PHP, CSS experts, those that have had experiences setting up business in Japan, crowd-sourcing or outsourcing, successful collaborations. Our discussions sometimes drift into geeky regions but we try to keep it at a level where people unfamiliar can understand. If you are interested in websites - no matter at which level - we welcome you!

Right now we have no concrete talks for the meeting planned but if you feel like talking about something just let us know and we reserve a bit of time for you. You can talk about whatever is interesting for you.

We are having an organisation setup on github . If you feel like helping, having a problem or taking over the task please let me know! We are also looking for help.

If you are interested in talking about whatever-that-strike-your-fancy over drinks or food please join.

Thank you and looking forward to see you!

PS.: We have a strict seat limit, please RSVP for your friends as well!
