Golden Week is behind us, and the weather is heating up, so why not chill out with some cool web talks and meet designers and developers from around the Osaka area?

This month Christian Oliff will talk to us about how to improve the user experience of filling in forms on mobile with the `inputmode` attribute.

We'll be meeting at the same location as the April meetup, kindly provided by IDCF. After the talks there will be an opportunity to chat and get to know each other over drinks and food at a nearby izakaya.
