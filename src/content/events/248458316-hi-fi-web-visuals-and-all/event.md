Cherry blossoms are coming to town and so is another special presenter in March.

Shirley Wu, accomplished data visualization artist (http://sxywu.com), will interrupt her 3 month stay in Tokyo to visit us for a weekend and present her process of making data shine! Join us and be inspired by her approach.

We also have one more presenter slot waiting to be filled! In the past we asked you to send us proposals but usually we ended up contacting presenters through back-channels. We figured that it might be because of the way we asked: So, from this month onward we have an open form that you can use anytime! If you want to hear about a topic or you'd like to try presenting: please let us know through this form ðŸ‘‡

The event is free, but after the event we will head out for drinks usually to an Izakaya around the area. We chat and get to know each other better. We usually spend around 1000~2000å†† per person.

All we ask is that you bring good vibes and an open mind.
