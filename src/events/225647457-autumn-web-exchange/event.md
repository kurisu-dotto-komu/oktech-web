Hello Webweavers,

Fall has progressed, the leaves will turn red, the nights will be cooler and we will meet to listen and talk about the state of the responsive web and other things we care about.

Web developers and designers from Osaka or other corners of Kansai: you are welcome to join us at the Knowledge Salon for a nice exchange at the Knowledge Salon where we return to after two nice meetings at C7.

We usually have a wide range of topics. Be it databases, facebook logins, design workflows, internationalisation, code structures to github usually deep conversations get started in the second half of the meeting.

For the first half, Luna offered to be talking about responsive websites!

I am looking forward to her presentation and hope you will enjoy it too!

Note: After the meetup we usually go out for drinks and socializing to a nearby izakaya.
