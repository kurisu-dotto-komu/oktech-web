We want to thank everyone for coming to hang out with us at our [last event](https://www.meetup.com/osaka-web-designers-and-developers-meetup/events/297676223). It was a hit! This month, join us again for part 2.

Are you thinking about getting into tech? Are you worried about your previous career or education background? Join us this upcoming meet up featuring one of the members of our community.

This month, **Yuka Ishida** introduces us to her career journey from electrical engineer to front-end designer. She will cover the following topics:

* After finding your first job in the tech industry, how do you continue improving your skills?
* In team development, communication skills (teamwork) are just as crucial as technical skills.
* Even when changing industries from other fields to the IT industry, professional experience from other industries will always be valuable.

The presentation will go for about 20\~30 minutes, followed by discussion and then socializing amongst each other. Come learn from your peers, bring a business card or two, and share your story! You never know who will give you your big break!

Furthermore, if you have a topic that you would like to talk about we want to hear it! Take the chance and let us know via the → [Discord](https://owddm.com/discord).
