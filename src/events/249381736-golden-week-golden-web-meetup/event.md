What better way to start your Golden Week than with exciting talks about the web.

Christian Oliff has had long experience in developing "High performance Websites" and he is ready to share with us his best practices to make websites load fast and act quickly.

As if that wasn't enough, Aska Uda, an exceptional UX designer, will introduce her latest project on "UX/UI design of a marketing tool". This should have you on the edge of your seat if you are into getting better at designing the web.

As usual, all you need is a good mood and an open mind for the meetup.
After the talks we will be going out for drinks & we can continue our conversations at the nearby Izakaiya.

By the way: if you also would like the chance to present at our meetup or if you are interested in a specific topic, feel free to let us know ðŸ‘‡
