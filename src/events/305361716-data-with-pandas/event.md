Happy new year!

We hope you don't forget the Vitamin-D tablets because 2025 is start strong and we are having an early event on **Jan. 11th** where we hope to see you in best health!

For the first meetup of the year Karim will be diving with us into [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and look at why and how to take care of Data with one of Python's premier data frameworks. (→ [Thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1314135918852177952))

There is still a second presentation being prepared, but if you would also like to present something, even a lighting talk, please share it on [→ Discord](https://owddm.com/discord) in the #presentation-proposal channel.
